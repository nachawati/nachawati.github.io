# Step 3 â€“ Install Atom Packages for JSONiq

Next, we need to install some additional Atom packages to support JSONiq development. This is done using the Atom Package Manager (apm). Open up a Windows command prompt, and enter the following commands:

```bash
apm install linter
```

```bash
apm install language-jsoniq
```

```bash
apm install atom-runner
```
